# Blazorons3

This is a demo application that uses WebAssembly to run .NET Code on the client (browser) side by relying on the Blazor Front End Library.
From .NET ont the client side this application also communicates via WebSockets to a AWS API Gateway backed by Lambda Functions that respond to websocket requests. 

Amplify.yml is used to orchestrate CICD, CloudFront, S3 Bucket, and feature-branch deployment
